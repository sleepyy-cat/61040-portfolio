# About Me
*My name is Hanna Chen. I'm a senior at MIT double majoring in mathematics and computer science, and it's nice to meet you! [Here is a link to my substack blog.](https://sleepyycat.substack.com/)

Some fun facts about me:
1. I've played piano and violin for more than a decade.
2. My favorite music artists are Taylor Swift and Gracie Abrams (I actually saw Gracie in Boston this past summer!).
3. I have a fully elastic sleep schedule (which may or may not be a good thing). 

My goals for the semester:
1. Have fun in all my classes (especially this one).
2. Try not to be too sleep deprived.
3. Hang out with my friends more! Especially the ones who live farther away.
