## Problem Statement 

### Problem Domain: Personal Item Management

The domain of personal item management centers around the constant challenge of keeping track of one's many belongings. The frustration of misplacing items is a significant, recurring, and universal inconvenience that disrupts routines and causes stress. This is a major challenge in my personal life as well--I'm frequently affected by the time wasted and anxiety induced by searching for misplaced items. I hope to find better, more intuitive solutions that can help individuals such as myself counter the draining effects of the time lost to searching and the stress induced by cognitive overload.

### Problem: Reliance on Memory or Disorganized Memory Tools

When people store an item, they usually rely on their memory or a random scribbled note to retrieve it. This is impractical for several reasons: brain capacity and memory span are limited, the circumstances in which the item was stored may be easily forgotten, and any notes can be confusing out of context. One's future self no longer has access to the thoughts of their past self through memories or simple notes, which means that the lack of an organized and visual system leads to a myriad of confusion down the line. 

### Stakeholders

1. People with Bad Memory: these are the main users who struggle to recall where they stored belongings. These stakeholders currently have quite a difficult time with the problem, and they would be positively affected if the problem were to be solved.
2. Family Members: these are the people who live with or frequently talk to People with Bad Memory. These stakeholders currently have to spend a lot of effort helping or comforting the People with Bad Memory when they can't find their belongings, and they would be positively affected if the problem were to be solved.
3. Location Tracker Manufacturers: these are the companies that make trackers such as AirTags that are meant to help people locate belongings. These stakeholders currently gain a lot from people who have the above problem, and they would be negatively affected if the problem were to be solved. 
   
### Evidence

1. ["Why Do I Constantly Lose All My Stuff?" (Vice)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-do-i-constantly-lose-all-my-stuff/): An article that states that losing stuff is a normal part of the human experience. It demonstrates that this is a common problem that causes a lot of stress and frustration for many people, so an app to address it could be helpful.
2. ["Find my stuff: Home Inventory App" (Google Play Store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miquelcms.homeorganizer&hl=en_US&pli=1): A description of a pre-existing app for organizing home belongings. While this is more organized than relying on one's memory or a random scribbled note, it could still lead to confusions without proper context or visual organization, so there's room for improvement. 
3. ["The Brain's Built-In GPS System" (Psychology today)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/best-practices-in-health/202506/the-brains-built-in-gps-system#:~:text=The%20hippocampus%20creates%20mental%20maps,cues%20to%20form%20spatial%20maps.): An article that shows that creating mental maps (which means a good visualization) can help with understanding and memory. This supports my claim that a more organized visual system could be helpful for this problem.
4. ["Overview of Data Visualization" (NIH)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7303292/): An article about the importance of having visualizations of things to improve understanding. This supports the idea that having a visual system for loggings belongings could be helpful to both engaging the user and enabling the user to find their objects more easily. 
5. ["Here's How AirTags Work" (Travel + Leisure)](https://www.travelandleisure.com/how-do-airtags-work-7377946): An article about the convenience of AirTags for tracking belongings. This is a potential type of competition for my attempt at solving the problems, but it's also expensive and impractical to get AirTags for everything so this isn't too big of an issue.
