# Assignment 1

## I. Domains 

### (chosen 3 are bold and italicized, the rest are bold only)

1. **Messy handwriting:** I usually have good handwriting, but sometimes imperfections happen that drive my inner perfectionist crazy.

2. ***Misplacing my belongings:*** *I frequently misplace my belongings. Since I live in a small room, I have to put away seasonal things after that season ends. Because I enjoy being organized, I made a notes file on my phone to track all my belongings. I also loan out a lot of my belongings to friends.*

3. ***Music:*** *Music plays a large role in my life—I’ve played piano and violin for nearly a decade each, and I also listen to a lot of music of many genres. I enjoy making playlists with special themes (such as happy, sad, angry, love songs, etc.). For my instruments, outside of orchestra and other ensemble activities, I do a lot of solo practicing. I also enjoy learning new pieces every once in awhile.*

4. **Co-working:** I’m most productive when working around other people, so I enjoy co-working with my friends.

5. ***Fashion:*** *I enjoy all aspects of fashion. I like buying new clothes and shoes when I feel like my closet is lacking in a certain type of item. I find picking my outfit (from clothes to accessories) in the morning to be a really fun part of my day. I also enjoy having cool outfits for each specific type of occasion.*

6. **Self care:** I have a lot of goals for self care habits (drinking more water, good sleep, etc.) but I have trouble sticking to habits because I keep forgetting to.

7. **Organizing notes:** I take a lot of notes on random things, from schedules and to-do lists to random thoughts and inspirations. 

8. **Mahjong:** One of my favorite games of all time is mahjong, which I enjoy playing with friends or online against strangers or robots. 

9. **Journaling:** I want to get into journaling but have trouble staying consistent or coming up with good prompts and structure for my entries. 

10. **Doomscrolling:** As with most people of this generation, I waste way too much time doomscrolling on my phone.


## II. Problems

### (chosen 3 are bold and italicized, the rest are bold only)

1. **Misplacing belongings 1:** After each season ends, I put away the stuff specific for that season (for example, winter jackets or summer sandals), but when the season comes around again, I often forget where I put those things. I didn't choose this problem because I don't have too many distinct seasonal belongings (i.e. I only have some jackets for winter, or some shoes for summer, etc.), so it would be easy to keep track of these using a simple notes interface. I also think this is not a common problem, since most people (especially those who don't live in dorms) have specific storage spaces (i.e. closets) for off-season stuff. (This is an issue with indifference).

2. ***Misplacing belongings 2: a more creative belongings catalog:*** *Since I often lose track of my belongings, I have started a notes file where I write down where I put them, and try to update when I move them. However, with the accumulation of belongings, this list is getting increasingly complicated to look at. I chose this problem because a lot of people have issues with losing things, and a more clear or interactive way to keep track could be a helpful motivator for them to consistently update where they leave their belongings (it would be more fun than a simple notes-file format).*

3. **Misplacing belongings 3:** I often loan out my belongings (for example, clothes or stationery or hairdryer) to my friends, but then I forget about them, and my friends are sometimes absent-minded so they do as well. I didn't choose this problem because this can be resolved with better communication or a simple notes file, and if someone isn't willing to do that then an app wouldn't help. (This is an issue with antibodies).

4. ***Music 1: making special themed playlists:*** *When I try to pick out songs for my themed playlists, it's difficult because I have a lot of liked songs/songs in my main playlist, and it takes time to assess whether each song fits in with the current vibe. I chose this problem because a lot of people like making special playlists for different moods, so this would be appealing to a wide variety of audiences. I also think the potential solutions to this problem could be creative and fun to both design and use.*

5. **Music 2**: Although I do enjoy solo practicing, it gets a bit hard to feel motivated for it at times, especially without any sort of feedback. I didn't choose this problem because solving this would require a lot of users to both require and give feedback. Also, a lot of people are able to take lessons or otherwise get feedback from people in their lives (as in, not people from the internet), so this may not get much use. (This is an issue with critical mass or indifference). 

6. **Music 3**: I enjoy learning new pieces once in awhile, but it's hard to find a piece that can satisfy all of my requirements: help me improve the skills I'm currently working on, fit my current skill set, and enjoyable to play/listen to. I didn't choose this problem because this would require too large of a database (since there are so many pieces out there for each instrument), along with many other factors such as assessing personal taste, defining skill levels, and categorizing skill sets of all pieces. (This is an issue with overambition).

7. **Fashion 1:** I like buying new clothes and shoes, but I often see something I like and buy it just to realize I already have one (or multiple) at home. I didn't choose this problem because the idea for solving this would just be cataloging all of one's clothing items, which is doable in a spreadsheet. (This is an issue with indifference or insufficient differentiation).

8. **Fashion 2:** I'm really indecisive when it comes to picking outfits, and will often spend a long time trying on various different things. I didn't choose this problem because there already exist virtual clothing try-on apps (such as FitRoom) or outfit suggestor apps (even an AI bot like DeepSeek could do this). (This is an issue with insufficient differentiation).

9. ***Fashion 3: outfits for all occasions:*** *I enjoy having cool and non-repetitive outfits for every occasion, ranging from social occasions to weather occasions, but sometimes an event comes up and then I realize I don't have the proper items for it. I chose this problem because frantic last-minute shopping happens to a lot of people, and so there could be a large set of targeted audience.*

## III. Stakeholders

1. **A more creative belongings catalog**: ADHD/Bad Memory Users (people who struggle to find things/recall where they put things); Family Members (people who live with/frequently talk to the targeted users); Location Tracker Manufacturers (companies who make trackers such as AirTags that were meant to help people locate belongings). ADHD/Bad Memory Users would have an easier time with keeping track of their belongings, since a visualization is especially helpful to a lot of people. Family Members would also have an easier time since they would need to spend less effort helping the users find their belongings. Location Tracker Manufacturers could see a decline in use of their creations, since this app would solve the problem that they're trying to solve without needing to physically purchase AirTags or the like.

2. **Making special themed playlists**: Music Artists (people who create music); Music Listeners (people who listen to music); Streaming Services (services that provide easily accessible music). Impacts: Music Artists would gain more popularity if their songs are more easily included in playlists, but they may be upset if their songs are horribly misclassified (i.e. interpreted as a completely different mood). Music Listeners would find it more convenient to make playlists for various occasions, which would be beneficial for them. Streaming Services would potentially have higher user retention rate since being able to easily curate playlists to one's tastes would encourage users to keep using the app, but services that don't use this extension idea would risk losing users to services that do use it.

3. **Outfits for all occasions**: Fashionistas (people who enjoy styling themselves); Personal Stylists (people who style others for a living); Clothing Retail Stores (stores that sell clothing). Impacts: Fashionistas would have an easier time with styling themselves and save time/money by not needing to last minute shop. Personal Stylists may have an easier time if they can draw inspiration from this app, but they may also get squeezed out of jobs because their tasks would be taken over by the app. Clothing Retail Stores lose the opportunity to make more money off of selling things last-minute to people (for example, they could've been able to raise the prices for things but people would be desperate to buy them and thus willing to spend the money).
